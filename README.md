A collection of my small scale python projects

drinkmanager.py

A program that creates/edits a text file that can add cocktail recipes by their title, their base spirit, and the link to the recipe.

my_bookshelf.py

A program that modifies an Excel sheet that keeps track of my physical library and other aspects about the books such as length, genre, reading status and a review if the status is finished.
